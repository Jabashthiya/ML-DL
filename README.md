# Machine Learning Models Demonstration

## Overview
This script (`ml_models_demo.py`) demonstrates various machine learning models using the **scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, and **Keras** libraries. It includes implementations of:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for MNIST classification**
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with SimpleRNN**
- **Bidirectional LSTMs for Sentiment Analysis (IMDB Dataset)**

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the script:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow keras
```

## Usage
Run the script using Python:

```sh
python ml_models_demo.py
```

## Description of Models

### 1. **Linear Regression**
- Predicts continuous values using a linear function.
- Example: Predicting a numeric value based on input features.

### 2. **Logistic Regression**
- A classification algorithm used for binary labels.
- Example: Classifying data into two categories.

### 3. **K-Means Clustering**
- An unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering similar data points.
- Example: Clustering data into two or more groups.

### 4. **Decision Trees**
- A classification model that splits data into different branches to make predictions.
- Example: Classifying boolean values based on input features.

### 5. **Random Forest**
- An ensemble learning method that improves classification performance.
- Example: Classifying simple binary data.

### 6. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
- A deep learning model for image classification.
- Example: Classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

### 7. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with SimpleRNN**
- A neural network model designed for sequential data.
- Example: Classifying MNIST data using RNN layers.

### 8. **Bidirectional LSTMs for Sentiment Analysis**
- An NLP model that processes text data bidirectionally.
- Example: Classifying movie reviews as positive or negative (IMDB dataset).

## Output
Each section of the script prints:
- Model performance (accuracy, loss, or prediction values).
- Visualization (for clustering and CNNs where applicable).
- Summary statistics for deep learning models.

## Conclusion
This script provides a hands-on approach to implementing different ML models, offering insight into supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning techniques. It is an excellent reference for beginners and intermediate learners.
